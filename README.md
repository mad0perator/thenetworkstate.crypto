# thenetworkstate.crypto webpage

[thenetworkstate.crypto][page] is a decentralized web3 page that redirects
guest to [thenetworkstate.com][book]. The much anticipated book,
*The Network State* by Balaji Srinivasan, was released on July 4, 2022,
and is available for purchase from Amazon Kindle with this [link][tobuy].

The webpage is hosted on IPFS using an NFT domain from 
[Unstoppable Domains][referral]. The blockchain domain was minted on the
Polygon network gas-free courtesy of Unstoppable Domains and is owned by
[mad0perator.crypto][me]. It is pinned on [Pinata][cloud] where I used
[DNSLink][dns] to resolve the address. Currently, Brave browser and Opera
resolve these links natively. I have not tested on other browsers.

There are other great features of the NFT domain that are out of scope for
this project.
